    "detailed_description": "Trend Micro Ransomware File Decryptor User Guide\n\n1. General Information\n\nThis tool is provided by Trend Micro to attempt recovery of files encrypted by certain types of ransomware. There is no guarantee of successful decryption for every ransomware variant; in some cases, only partial recovery may be possible.\n\nThe most effective protection against ransomware includes:\n\t\u2022\tPerforming regular backups\n\t\u2022\tKeeping the operating system and applications up to date\n\t\u2022\tUsing an up-to-date security solution\n\n\u2e3b\n\n2. Supported Ransomware Types\n\nThe tool supports CryptXXX (V1\u2013V5), TeslaCrypt (V1\u2013V4), CERBER V1, Locky, Jigsaw, Nemucod, Chimera, XORIST, BadBlock, and several other ransomware families listed in the documentation.\nNote: For TeslaCrypt V1 and V2, it may be necessary to contact Trend Micro Technical Support separately.\n\n\u2e3b\n\n3. Downloading and Running the Tool\n\t1.\tDownload the Trend Micro Ransomware File Decryptor from the official Trend Micro website.\n\t2.\tExtract the ZIP file.\n\t3.\tRun the RansomwareFileDecryptor.exe file.\n\t4.\tAccept the End User License Agreement (EULA).\n\n\u2e3b\n\n4. Step-by-Step Usage\n\nStep 1: Select the Ransomware Type\n\t\u2022\tIf you know the ransomware type from the ransom note left on the system, select it from the list.\n\t\u2022\tIf you are unsure, you can select the \u201cI don\u2019t know the ransomware name\u201d option. In this case, the tool will attempt to automatically identify the ransomware based on the file signature.\n\nStep 2: Select the Encrypted File or Folder\n\t\u2022\tYou can select a single file or an entire folder (including subfolders).\n\t\u2022\tClick the \u201cSelect & Decrypt\u201d button to make your selection.\n\nStep 3: Start the Decryption Process\n\t\u2022\tThe tool will automatically begin scanning and decrypting files.\n\t\u2022\tThe duration of the process may vary depending on the number of files and the ransomware type.\n\t\u2022\tIf needed, the process can be stopped by clicking the \u201cStop\u201d button.\n\nStep 4: Cases Requiring Additional Information (Optional)\n\t\u2022\tFor certain ransomware types such as CryptXXX V1, XORIST, XORBAT, or Nemucod, the tool may request additional information.\n\t\u2022\tIn this case:\n\t\u2022\tSelect an encrypted file\n\t\u2022\tSelect the same file in its unencrypted form (from a backup, if available)\n\t\u2022\tLarger file sizes are preferred\n\nStep 5: Completing the Process\n\t\u2022\tOnce the process is completed, the results screen will be displayed.\n\t\u2022\tBy selecting \u201cSee encrypted files,\u201d the folder containing the files will be opened.\n\t\u2022\tDecrypted files will be located in the same folder.\n\t\u2022\tClick \u201cDone\u201d to return to the main screen.\n\n\u2e3b\n\n5. Important Notes\n\t\u2022\tFor CryptXXX V3, it may not be possible to fully recover all files.\n\t\u2022\tIf files were encrypted without changing their original names, decrypted files will be saved with a \u201cdecrypted\u201d suffix.\n\t\u2022\tSuccessful decryption is not guaranteed for every file.",
